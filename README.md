## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Server**: Ubuntu 20.04+ with 6GB RAM, 50GB storage
- **Control Machine**: Ansible 2.9+, Python 3.8+
- **Domain**: Valid domain with DNS management access

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-stack.git
cd devops-stack

# Create configuration from templates
cp inventory/hosts.yml.example inventory/hosts.yml
cp group_vars/vault.yml.example group_vars/vault.yml
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment
```bash
# Edit inventory with your server details
nano inventory/hosts.yml

# Edit vault with your configuration
nano group_vars/vault.yml
# Set:
# - vault_project_name: "your-project-name"
# - vault_organization: "Your Company"
# - vault_domain: "your-domain.com"
# - Generate secure passwords for all services
```

### 3. Security Setup
```bash
# Generate secure passwords
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Password $i: $(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '=+/' | cut -c1-25)"
done

# Encrypt sensitive data
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/vault.yml
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
make setup
make ping
make deploy
